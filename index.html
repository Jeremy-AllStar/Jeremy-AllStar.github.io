            <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p> My name is Jeremy and I am from Bronx, New York. My parents are also from Ghana making me a proud African American.
                    I enjoy doing lots of things like coding on different languages, playing sports, and just having a great time with friends. I enjoy doing these things because these are what make me the happiest no matter what I am feeling. 
                    In the near future I want to find accesss to many internships so I can pursue my dream to become an eletrical engineer. The reason for this is because I want to be a successful black man when I grow up 
                    and in order to do this I know that I will need to work hard as a kid so it can pay off in the future. Although some may make the case that racism has ended, I do not believe it because people 
                    are still being mistreated even as you read this, I want to achieve a dream of becoming a man who can overcome these challeneges.

                <h2>My Skills</h2>
                <p>There are many things I can say I am good at but, I can say with confidence that these skills are what I am proficent 
                    at. Basketball is a sport I take very seriously, I play for Church Farm School, the high school I currently attend, 
                    and it has been a journey. I am now part of the Varsity team as a rising junior and is really exicted for what this 
                    season has in store for me. The next thing I am proficent at is flying/programming a drone. Over the course of 3 years
                    I have been part of the STEP program in Bronx Community College where we do many things but drones are what catch my 
                    attention; at the program I have completed many drone challenges and have even won multiple drone races with professors and 
                    friends. The last thing I will say I am proficient at is coding. All Star code is a great program for young men like me who 
                    desire to become successful in this world and they have helped me take my fisrt step into achieving this. I can now code 
                    Javascript, CSS, and HTML.
